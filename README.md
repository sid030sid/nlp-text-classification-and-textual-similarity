# NLP: Text classification and textual similarity

## About
This project firstly creates a binary classifier based on na√Øve Bayes. Its purpose is determing whether a text is spam or not. After creation, the dependency of the classifier's performance on different vectorization methods is tested (see ```spam_classifier.py```). To be within the scope, this projects limits itself to the vectorization methods: bag of words, tf-idf, bag of N-Gram (n=2) and bag of N-Gram (n=1 and 2). Secondly, this project analysis the similarity between spam messages (see ```textual_similarity.py```). As a first step for reproducing this project's work, it is recommended to analysis the data (see ```data_analysis.py```).
